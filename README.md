# Manfred Awesomic CV

The MAC (or Manfred Awesomic CV) is a(nother) naive attemp to create **a standard open source format to define and share CVs**.

!["JSON Schema"](https://github.com/getmanfred/mac/blob/master/assets/readme/schema_screen_capture.png?raw=true "JSON Schema")

The format is defined as [a JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate CVs stored as JSON files.
